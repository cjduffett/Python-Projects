# Python-Projects

Samples of my Python coding skills. Much of this repository contains solutions to Google Codejam problems.
To date I have solved the following challenges:

1. **[Always Turn Left](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/32003/dashboard#s=p1)** - Generates maps for a series of mazes given only a list of instructions (walk, turn left, turn right) to navigate each maze  
2. **[File Fix-It](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/635101/dashboard#s=p0)** - Determines the number of mkdir operations needed to add a list of folders to a filesystem, given a list of folders already in the filesystem
3. **[Reverse Words](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/351101/dashboard#s=p1)** - Given a series of sentences this reverses the order of words in each sentence
4. **[Store Credit](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/351101/dashboard#s=p0)** - Given a desired sum (credit) and a list of available items (numbers), this determines which two numbers in the list of items add up to the credit
5. **[T9 Spelling](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/351101/dashboard#s=p2)** - Given a desired message, this generates the needed key presses to type the message on a standard phone numpad
